      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p style="display: block">
        Fried rice is a versatile and flavorful dish that originated in China
        but has become popular worldwide. It typically consists of cooked rice
        stir-fried in a wok or frying pan with a variety of ingredients such as
        vegetables, eggs, meat, and seasonings. The rice is often cooked with
        soy sauce, which not only adds a savory flavor but also gives the dish
        its characteristic brown color.

        <li>Cooked rice</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>Sesame Oil</li>
        <li>Chopped Vegetables</li>
        <li>Protein (Chicken, Pork, Beef)</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Seasonings</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Prepare the Rice: If you're using fresh rice, cook it according to
          package instructions and let it cool completely. For best results,
          however, use day-old rice that has been refrigerated overnight. This
          helps to dry out the grains and prevents the fried rice from becoming
          mushy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prep Ingredients: Chop all vegetables, protein, and aromatics such as
          garlic, ginger, and green onions. Have all ingredients ready and
          within reach, as fried rice cooks quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat the Pan: Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add a
          tablespoon of vegetable oil or sesame oil and swirl to coat the pan
          evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Saut√© Aromatics: Add minced garlic and ginger to the hot oil and
          stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Be careful not to burn
          them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook Protein: If using raw meat or seafood, add it to the pan and cook
          until it's almost fully cooked through. If using pre-cooked protein
          like leftover chicken or shrimp, you can add it later with the
          vegetables.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add Vegetables: Add chopped vegetables to the pan and stir-fry for a
          few minutes until they are tender-crisp. Common vegetables include
          onions, carrots, peas, bell peppers, and corn. You can also add any
          other vegetables you like.
        </li>
        <li>
          Push Ingredients Aside: Push the cooked ingredients to one side of the
          pan, creating an empty space. Pour the beaten eggs into the empty
          space and let them cook for a few seconds until they start to set.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combine and Stir: Once the eggs start to set, stir them gently to
          scramble, breaking them into small pieces. Then, mix them with the
          rest of the ingredients in the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add Rice: Add the cooked rice to the pan, breaking up any clumps with
          a spatula. Stir-fry everything together, mixing well to ensure that
          the rice is evenly coated with the other ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
          Season with Soy Sauce: Drizzle soy sauce over the fried rice, starting
          with a few tablespoons and adjusting to taste. Be cautious not to add
          too much at once, as it can make the rice too salty. Stir well to
          distribute the soy sauce evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Taste and Adjust: Taste the fried rice and adjust the seasoning as
          needed with salt, pepper, or more soy sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Garnish and Serve: Once the fried rice is heated through and evenly
          seasoned, remove it from the heat. Garnish with chopped green onions
          (scallions) and any other desired toppings such as sesame seeds or
          sliced almonds. Serve hot as a delicious main dish or side dish.
