      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Beef Pho, a quintessential Vietnamese comfort food, is a fragrant and
        soul-warming noodle soup that captivates with its depth of flavor and
        aromatic spices. At its heart lies a rich and clear broth, brewed
        meticulously over hours to extract the essence of beef bones, infused
        with spices like star anise, cinnamon, cloves, and cardamom, resulting
        in a broth that is both robust and delicately perfumed. Thinly sliced
        tender beef, typically raw or lightly cooked, is added to the piping hot
        broth just before serving, allowing it to cook gently in the warmth of
        the soup. The soup is generously ladled over soft, translucent rice
        noodles, which soak up the flavors of the broth while retaining their
        satisfying chewiness. The bowl is then garnished with an assortment of
        fresh herbs like Thai basil, cilantro, and culantro, along with crisp
        bean sprouts, sliced chili peppers, and lime wedges, allowing diners to
        customize each spoonful to their liking. With its complex interplay of
        flavors and textures, Beef Pho offers a comforting and invigorating
        culinary experience that transcends its humble origins, earning it a
        cherished place in Vietnamese cuisine and the hearts of food lovers
        around the world.

      <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place beef bones in a large stockpot and cover with water. Bring to a
          boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer gently for
          at least 1 hour (ideally 4-6 hours), skimming any foam that rises to
          the surface.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add halved onion, sliced ginger, star anise, cinnamon stick, cloves,
          and cardamom pods to the pot. Continue to simmer, uncovered, for
          another 1-2 hours, allowing the flavors to meld and the broth to
          develop depth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Season the broth with salt, sugar, and fish sauce to taste, adjusting
          the seasoning as needed to achieve a balance of savory, sweet, and
          salty flavors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove
          the solids, leaving behind a clear and flavorful broth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, cook the rice noodles according to package instructions
          until they are al dente. Drain and rinse the noodles under cold water
          to stop the cooking process and prevent them from sticking together.
        </li>
        <li>
          Divide the cooked noodles among serving bowls and top with thinly
          sliced raw beef.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring the strained broth back to a simmer and ladle it over the
          noodles and beef, ensuring that the beef is fully submerged in the hot
          broth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve the beef pho piping hot, garnished with fresh herbs like Thai
          basil, cilantro, and culantro, along with bean sprouts, sliced chili
          peppers (if using), and lime wedges on the side.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow diners to customize their bowls with additional herbs, sprouts,
          chili peppers, and lime juice according to their taste preferences.
          Enjoy the comforting and aromatic flavors of homemade beef pho!
