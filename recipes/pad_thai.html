      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Pad Thai is a beloved and iconic Thai dish renowned for its harmonious
        blend of flavors and textures. It typically consists of stir-fried rice
        noodles, which are cooked to perfection, tender yet with a delightful
        chewiness. The dish is often enriched with a choice of protein, such as
        succulent shrimp, tender chicken, or tofu, lending a satisfying
        heartiness to each bite. Complementing the noodles and protein are a
        colorful array of fresh vegetables, including crisp bean sprouts and
        vibrant green onions, adding a refreshing crunch and a burst of
        freshness. What truly sets Pad Thai apart, however, is its signature
        sauceâ€”a harmonious fusion of tangy tamarind, savory fish sauce, subtle
        sweetness from sugar, and a hint of heat from chili flakes, perfectly
        balancing sweet, sour, salty, and spicy notes. Garnished with a generous
        sprinkle of chopped roasted peanuts and a squeeze of zesty lime, Pad
        Thai tantalizes the palate with its complex yet harmonious flavor
        profile, making it a favorite among Thai cuisine enthusiasts worldwide.

      <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Soak rice noodles in warm water for about 30 minutes until they become
          pliable but still firm. Drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prepare Pad Thai sauce by combining tamarind paste, fish sauce, soy
          sauce, sugar, and chili flakes in a bowl. Adjust the ingredients to
          achieve the desired balance of sweet, sour, salty, and spicy flavors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.
          Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
          If using protein such as shrimp, chicken, or tofu, add it to the
          skillet and cook until it's almost fully cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>
          Push the protein to one side of the skillet and crack eggs into the
          empty space. Scramble the eggs until they are cooked through, then mix
          them with the protein.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add soaked rice noodles to the skillet and stir-fry until they are
          tender and coated with the other ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the Pad Thai sauce over the noodles and toss everything together
          until the noodles are evenly coated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add bean sprouts and chopped green onions to the skillet and toss for
          another minute until they are heated through.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the Pad Thai to serving plates and garnish with chopped
          roasted peanuts, fresh cilantro (if using), and lime wedges.
        </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy your delicious homemade Pad Thai!</li>
